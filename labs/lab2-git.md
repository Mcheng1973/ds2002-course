# Lab 2: GitHub

Follow all the steps below for practice using GitHub. You an use your web browser to complete these steps, or the terminal if you like.

Create a single GitHub Gist to submit the URLs you create in these steps, and submit it for grading.

## 1. Git/GitHub Basics

Go to https://uvads.github.io/git-basics/ and work through pages 0, 1, and 2. When setting up `git` CLI authentication, I strongly suggest SSH key authentication. However, if you already have this set up, you do not need to change.

To test your understanding, be sure you understand how to do the following well:

- Install the `git` command-line and authenticate to GitHub using SSH key authentication
- Create a repository in GitHub and clone it to your local machine.
- Add, commit, and push/pull changes to your GitHub repository.
- Fork an existing repository owned by someone else.
- Check the status of your local repository using `git status`.
- Display the commit log for a repository using `git log`.
- See changes made to a file using `git diff`.

## 2. Practice With GitHub Skills

1. Go to **GitHub Skills** https://skills.github.com/
2. Find the first lesson, "Introduction to GitHub" and right-click on the link to open it in a new browser tab.
3. Read the page closely, paying attention to what you will do in this lesson.
4. Right-click on the "Start course" button to open it in a new brower tab.
5. Follow the instructions closely to copy their lesson into your own account.
6. Once that is complete, wait about 20 seconds and refresh the page in your copy of the lesson.
7. Follow the instructions to complete the lesson.
8. Once complete, go back to https://skills.github.com/ and complete the "Review pull requests" lesson using the same steps as above.

Add the URLs to the two new repositories you created in this step to the GitHub Gist.

## 3. Set up your GitHub Profile README Page

You can use GitHub to showcase your own work, interests, and projects. [Follow these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/setting-up-your-profile#adding-a-profile-readme) to set up yours. [Here](https://github.com/schacon/) is a good example from Scott Chacon.

Add the URL to your GitHub Profile page to the GitHub Gist.

## BONUS: Create a GitHub Pages website

Follow [these instructions](https://pages.github.com/) and create a "user" site. A few examples:

- https://schacon.github.io/
- https://nmagee.github.io/
- https://mk.gg/
